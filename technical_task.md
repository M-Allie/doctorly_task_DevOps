doctorly DevOps technical task
The focus of this assignment is to evaluate your skills as a potential doctorly DevOps
employee within our cross functional teams. This is not a hardcore test and its aim is to
allow you to express your opinions and knowledge.
  ● Results as well as explanation/documentation should be submitted on Github or Gitlab
and develop the task in a similar manner as to how you would develop a task for your
work
  ● The tasks should be completed within at most 4 hours total time
  ● We request that you send us an email with your submission no later than 4 hours after
receiving the task
  ● We do not expect you to build a full system in the couple of hours assigned to this task.
Instead, we want to see a reasonable start. Get as far as you can. This can be the
scaffolding and some architectural choices that will serve as the prototype for future
development. Your answers can be showcased in multiple ways, code, diagrams,
research paper etc.
  ● We will schedule a meeting after the completion of the tasks and our review of them to
discuss them with you
